// You might not need to have explicit command for this if the game happens to already have state changes that are natural places
// to send and ACK the packets, but in this demo they are needed to keep the transmissions ping ponging.

#define I_GOT_THE_PACKET    63     // Signal that we got the packet so they can stop sending.

    A handshake is nessisary to account for missed messages in either direction, which can potentially happen at any time
    over the IR link. We could, for example, just blind send the new data but what if that packet was missed? How would we
    know to resend it? That's what the I_GOT_THE_PACKET dance is for, so we can keep resending until we know the other side got it. 

    Here is how the packet send dance works...

    T wants to send a packet to R.

    T sends the packet until it gets an I_GOT_THE_PACKET from R.

    When R gets a packet, it sends I_GOT_THE_PACKET until it sees something that is not a packet from T.
    
    
    Since this API presents a state-based model, the right way to do this would be to treat the packets like all other face vales.
    You could call setValueOnFace() with a byte, or an array of bytes and the blink would continuously send whatever you set and the other side
    we see with getLastValueReceivedonFace().

    Unfortunately this just doesn't work on this resource constrained platform because each face would need about 100 bytes of extra buffers
    for this to work. It would also be butt slow to keep sending these very long messages continuously and we would loose our required
    10Hz refresh rate.

    So instead we basically have to build an event based model on top of the state based model (which is itself built on an event model!).
    Those PACKET-based states are not really states, it is the transitions between the states that simulate events.

    Things are much simpler in an event-driven model, and maybe games that need big packets should use the event driven API. The state
    API is probably best for games like the old school ones that really are state based.
