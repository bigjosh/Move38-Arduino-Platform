    Talk to the 6 IR LEDs that are using for communication with adjacent tiles


    THEORY OF OPERATION
    ===================

    The IR LEDs detect pulses of light.

    A bit is represented by the space between two pulses of light. A short space is a '1' and a long space is a '0'.

    A transmission is sent as a series of 8 bits.

    We always send a preamble of "10" before the data bits. This allows the receiver to detect the
    incoming byte. This sequence is special because (1) the only way a '1' can end up in the top bit
    of the buffer is if we have received enough consecutive valid bits, and (2) the following '0'
    guards against the case where we send an opening '1' bit but it just happens to come right after the
    receiver had spontaneously fired. In this case, we might see these two fires (the spontaneous one
    and the intentional start of the preamble one) as a valid '1' bit. The extra '0' ensure that only the second
    intentional '1' bit will have a '0' after it and the phantom '1' will be pushed off the top of the buffer.

    There are 6 data bits after the preamble. MSB sent first.

    There must be an idle gap after the end of each transmission.

    Internally, we use an 8-bit buffer to store incoming bits. We check to see if the top two
    bit of the buffer match the '10' preamble sequence to know if we have received a good transmission.

    If we ever go too long between pulses, we reset the incoming buffer to '0' to avoid
    detecting a phantom message.

    TODO: When noise causes a face to wake us from sleep too much, we can turn off the mask bit for a while.

    TODO: MORE TO COME HERE - NEED PICTURES.
