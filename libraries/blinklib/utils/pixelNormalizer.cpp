    Happy New Years - 2018

    Firecracker

    Rules:
    If button pressed...
    explode with firecracker like flashing of lights
    when done, pick one of my neighbors to send the spark to
    if receive spark, explode like firecracker
    remember who I received it from
    when done, pick one of my other neighbors to send the spark to
    if no other neighbors available, firecracker is extinguished
