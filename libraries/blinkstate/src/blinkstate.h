/*
 * blinkstate.h
 *
 * This defines a statefull view of the blinks tile interactions with neighbors.
 *
 * In this view, each tile has a "state" that is represented by a number between 1 and 127.
 * This state value is continuously broadcast on all of its faces.
 * Each tile also remembers the most recently received state value from he neighbor on each of its faces.
 *
 * Note that this library depends on the blinklib library for communications with neighbors. The blinklib
 * IR read functions are not available when using the blinkstate library.
 *
 * Note that the beacon transmissions only occur when the loop() function returns, so it is important
 * that sketches using this model return from loop() frequently.
