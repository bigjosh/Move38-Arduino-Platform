/*
 *
 *   This library presents a higher level abstraction of state and communications and sits on top of the blinklib IR functions.
 *
 * In this view, each tile has a "state" that is represented by a number between 1 and 127.
 * This state value is continuously broadcast on all of its faces.
 * Each tile also remembers the most recently received state value from he neighbor on each of its faces.
 *
 * This library takes over the blinklib IR read functions since it needs to consume the events they produce.
 *
 * Note that the beacon transmissions only occur when the loop() function returns, so it is important
 * that sketches using this model return from loop() frequently. This is modeled on the idomatic Arduino
 * way of handling periodic callbacks...
