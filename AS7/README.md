# AS7

This directory holds an Atmel Studio 7 Solution and Project with all the firmware files.

All files are included as links to the arduino directories, so any updates you make in AS7 will be reflected in the arduino structure.

There is a project temple here called `` that makes it easy to create new sketches that use the `blinkslib` library. You need to import this zip file into Atmel Studio...

...and then you can use "Add New Project..." to quickly make new sketches with all the setting and directories right.

After you are done, you can copy and paste the source code into a INO file in the Arduino IDE. 

I much prefer working in AS7 to the Arduino IDE so it was worth the effort to make this.
