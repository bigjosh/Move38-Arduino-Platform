    Control the 6 RGB LEDs visible on the face of the tile


    THEORY OF OPERATION
    ===================
    
	The pixels are multiplexed so that only one is lit at any given moment. 
	The lit pixel is selected by driving its anode high and then driving the common
	cathodes of the red, green, and blue LEDs inside each pixel with a PWM signal to control the brightness.
	
	The PWM signals are generated by hardware timers, so these cathodes can only be connected to
	pins that have timer functions on them.	
	
	An ISR driven by a timer interrupt steps though the sequence of anodes. 
	This is driven by the same timer that generates the PWM signals, and we pick our polarities sothat
	the LEDs light up at the end of each PWM cycle so that the ISR has time to step to the next LED
	before it actually lights up. 
	
	The PWM timing is slightly complicated by the fact that the compare values that generate the PWM signals are 
	loaded from a hardware buffer at the end of each PWM cycle, so we need to load the values of the NEXT
	pixel while the current pixel is still being driven. 
	
	The blue cathode is slightly different. It has a charge pump to drive the cathode voltage lower than 0V
	so it will still work even when the battery is lower than the blue forward voltage (~2.5V).
	A second timer drives the charge pump high to charge it up, then low to generate the negative cathode voltage.
	The means that the blue diode is out of phase with red and green ones. The blue hardware timer is
	lockstep with the one that generates the red and green PWM signals and the ISR interrupt.
