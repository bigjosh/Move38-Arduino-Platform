// User supplied callback that is called when the button state changes.
// Note that you could get multiple consecutive calls with the 
// Same state if the button quickly toggles back and forth quickly enough that
// we miss one phase. This is particularly true if there is a keybounce exactly when
// an ISR is running. 

// I know that you think you want to know if the button was up or down passed to the callback
// but that is false security. You never know how long the button will be down for, and you don't
// know the interrupt latency between the button change that triggers the interrupt and when
// you are going to get to sample it. Heck, even if there was 0 interrupt latency, the button could
// still contact long enough to trigger the interrupt but not to show up on the pin read.
// Much more rigorous to think in terms of state changes than absolute values.

// Enable callback to button_callback_onChange on button change interrupt
// Typically used to wake from sleep, but could also be used for low latency
// button decoding - but remeber that there is not 1:1 mapping of changes on the
// button pin to calls to the ISR, so timer-based button decoding likely easier
// and more efficient.

// Call after button_enable()
