/*
 * ir_callback.h
 * 
 * This head file connects the overflow ISR in Timer.cpp to the periodic IR decoder. 
 *
 * I can't think of a more elegant way to do this without the overhead of a functrion pointer, can you?
 * This only needs to be included in timer.cpp and ir.cpp.
 *
 * THis makes me think that IR decode should be handled at the next higher layer.
