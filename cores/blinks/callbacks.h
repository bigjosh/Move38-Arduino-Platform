// Some helpers for making asynchronous callbacks without leaving interrupts off for too long
// We do this by catching the hardware interrupt and then enabling interrupts before calling the
// callback. We then use a flag to prevent re-entering the callback. If the flag is set when the
// callback completes, then we call into it again so it can see that another interrupt happened
// while it was running. This effectively combines all interrupts while the callback is running into
// a single trailing call. Note that the process repeats if another interrupt happens during that
// trailing call.

// TODO: Make these ISR naked so we can really optimize reentrant interrupts into just
// an SBI and a iret.

// Keep all these callback flags in register GPIOR) because we can SBI and CLI
// on this register with a single instruction that does not change anything else.

#define CALLBACK_REG GPIOR0

// Each reentrant interrupt gets two bits in this register
// The `running` bit means that the callback is currently running, so do not re-eneter it
// The `pending` bit means that another interrupt has happened while the running one was executing so
// we need to call again when it finishes.
