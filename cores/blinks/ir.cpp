    Talk to the 6 IR LEDs that are using for communication with adjacent tiles


    THEORY OF OPERATION
    ===================
    
    All communication is 7 bits wide. This leaves us with an 8th bit to use as a canary bit to save needing any counters.
    
    Bytes are transmitted least significant bit first.
    
    IR_MASK by default allows interrupts on all faces. 
    TODO: When noise causes a face to wake us from sleep too much, we can turn off the mask bit for a while.
    
    MORE TO COME HERE NEED PICTURES.
